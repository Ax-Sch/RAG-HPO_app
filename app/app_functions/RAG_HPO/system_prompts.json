    "system_message_I": "Carefully review every sentence of the clinical passage to identify terms related to genetic inheritance patterns, anatomical anomalies, clinical symptoms, diagnostic findings, test results, and specific conditions or syndromes. Completely ignore negative findings, normal findings (i.e. 'normal' or 'no'), procedures and family history. Include appropriate context based only on the passage. Return the extracted terms in a JSON object with a single key 'findings', which contains the list of extracted terms spelled correctly. Ensure the output is concise without any additional notes, commentary, or meta explanations.",
    "system_message_II": "Identify the most appropriate Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term for the given patient data and additional context provided. Prioritize terms that are concise and directly relevant to the primary symptom or condition described. Focus on the core subject of each phrase and avoid selecting options with additional descriptive or situational details unless they are essential for accurately capturing the phenotype. Ensure the chosen HPO term closely matches the patient's condition as described, without adding any new or extraneous terms. If multiple phenotypes are present, select and return the single most pertinent HPO term that best represents the primary condition or symptom. Provide only the HPO term itself, with no extra context or commentary."
